Starting from the root (an empty plan), the algorithm explores various branches, but instead of examining every possible path, it employs a \"beam\" strategy to keep only the top K most promising branches at each level, effectively pruning the rest. This selective exploration ensures that the tree does not grow too large and unwieldy, focusing computational resources on extending only the most promising plans. As the algorithm progresses down the tree, it continuously evaluates and updates the best plan based on a scoring system, until it either reaches the maximum plan length or no further promising branches exist, culminating in the most optimal schedule of observations within the given constraints."
