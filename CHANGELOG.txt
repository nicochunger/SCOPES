0.3.3 - 07.08.2024

- Added tests for all classes from scheduler_components.
- Cleaner README with updated links.

0.3.2 - 06.08.2024

- Added matplotlib to the requirements and removed plotly from the top imports of scheduler_components.py
  This way plotly will only be imported when the plot_interactive() method is called.
- Added some __repr__ and __eq__ methods to the Program and Target classes.
- Fixed a bug in the Instrument class where the __repr__ was referencing an old attribute name.
- Get the logo from the GitHub URL instead of the local file of the repo. This way the logo can be
  displayed in PyPI.

0.3.1 - 05.08.2024

- Added a night_duration attribute to the night object. A datetime.timedelta object that represents 
  the duration of the night.

0.3.0 - 06.05.2024

- Implemented a Local Search Heuristic that optimizes the overall overhead time of a plan.
- The same for optimizing the score after the overheads are minimized.
- In the Overheads object, the slew can now take into account cable wrap limits.
- Simulation module was updated and works again
- Added a new phase_specific merit which is an improved version of the periodic gaussian merit.
  In this merit the sigma is actually the standard deviation of the gaussian in phase space.
- Added to_df() and to_csv() methods to Plan which create a pandas DataFrame of the Plan and saves
  it to a CSV file, respectively.
- Removed the print_plan() function and replaced it by printing the string representation of the 
  dataframe created by to_df()

0.2.0 - 07.03.2024

- Added a bunch of features, like the big overhaul of the Observation object and moving many of
  the tasks to the Scheduler.
- Added option to set an end time for a schedule (to only schedule part of the night)
- Many other things I don't remember (I just created this file to keep track of the changes)

0.1.0 - January 2024

- Initial release
