# SCOPES
## **S**ystem for **C**oordinating **O**bservational **P**lanning and **E**fficient **S**cheduling

Here I will start to developed the core systems and algorithms for the new automatic observations scheduler of EULER, which I call SCOPES (System for Coordinating Observational Planning and Efficient Scheduling).

I will base the main system on the work of Rooyen et al. (2018)

The package is installed with

```pip install .```

and then imported into python with

`import scopes`
